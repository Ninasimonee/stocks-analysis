# VBA_Challenge.xlsm
# Overview of Project
In this challenge the purpose was to refactor the code to loop through all the data to determine if this code made the VBA script run faster. The dataset includes the entire stock market over the last few years of 2017 and 2018. The refractered code purpose is to help the data script to run more efficient.
# Results
After running the script for both years, 2017 ran faster than 2018 in the refactored code. Overall, the code did have a better outcome after improving it and making it perform with less steps. You can also see from the data that 2017 had a better return outcome compared to 2018.
